                <h2>Safra Catz</h2>
                <h4>CEO of Oracle</h4>
                <div class="image_s" style="height:200px;"><img src="SafraCartz2.jpg" alt="Safra Cartz"></div>
                <p>As the chief executive officer of software giant Oracle, Safra Catz is one of the most powerful women in the world today. Known to carry a strong and determined persona, Catz has managed to maintain Oracle’s status as a global player despite seeing stiff competition from other companies such as Microsoft, Intel, and Amazon. Catz also belongs in the world’s highest-paid female CEOs list, averaging a net pay of $40 million per year.<br>

                    After more than a decade at DLJ, Catz joined Oracle Corporation in 1999 as senior vice president. Even at the beginning of her career at Oracle, she was determined to drastically improve the company’s financial standing through her experience at DLJ.   In less than two years, Catz was placed on the Oracle board and was also named as co-president in 2004. She is credited for the company’s acquisition of tech company PeopleSoft in 2005 for $10.3 billion. PeopleSoft previously specialized in the development of customer relationship, human resource, and financial management systems.   <br>
                    
                    Catz was named the company’s chief financial officer in 2005 where she would hold the position up to today (she relinquished the role from 2008 to 2011). In the years that followed, she didn’t just take on more leadership roles but also developed a strong partnership with Oracle founder and then CEO Lawrence Joseph Ellison (Larry Ellison). In fact, it was Ellison who personally recommended Catz to be included in the Oracle board. In 2010, Catz was named co-president together with Mark Hurd. Holding one of the company’s top positions, she would soon become a regular fixture in Forbes and Fortune’s most powerful women list. After Ellison stepped down in 2014 to assume the role of executive chair and chief technology officer, Catz together with Mark Hurd were chosen as the company’s co-presidents. Following the death of Hurd in 2019, Catz became Oracle’s sole chief executive. Even during her time as the company’s top financial officer, she was already pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy; a strategy that would carry over until she was appointed as co-president and then as CEO. She has completed more than 100 acquisitions since 2005 and has already completed three purchases in the past three years. Although she maintains an autocratic leadership style, requiring employees to strictly follow company policies and procedures, she also preaches a culture of humility and accountability. <br>
                    
                    Aside from PeopleSoft, other notable acquisitions under Catz’s watch include Hyperion Corporation for $3.3 billion (2007), BEA Systems for $8.5 billion (2008), Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion (2010), Acme Packet for $2.1 billion (2013), MICROS Systems for $5.3 billion (2014), and NetSuite for $9.3 billion (2016). Many consider the NetSuite acquisition as the biggest in Oracle’s 44-year history since Netsuite’s suite of software services was previously used by 40,000 companies in 100 countries. The company also made headlines when it acquired Sun Microsystems and MICROS, with the former best known for developing the Java programming language and the Solaris operating system while the latter provided enterprise applications for over 330,000 businesses in 180 countries. </p>

                    In 2016, Churchill was awarded the Athena Award for Executive Leadership Award from the University of California's Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute.[16] Churchill was elected a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 2019 for "contributions to human-computer interaction and service to the ACM" .[17] She has received honorary doctorates from the University of Sussex in the UK (2018) [18] and from Stockholm University in Sweden (2019) for sustained contributions to the fields of Human Computer Interaction and Social Computing.<br>

                    Crawford co-founded New York University's AI Now Institute in 2017, the first university institute dedicated to researching the social impact of AI, and the first women-led and founded AI institute. The institute's goal is to change how researchers look at AI and expand their interpretation of it from a technical standpoint to include history, sociology and law to inform their development decisions.</p>
