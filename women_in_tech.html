            <h2>Women In Tech</h2>
            <p>Technology today influences every aspect life, constantly changing and becoming more progressive.<br> But while the word "technology" suggests innovation and progress, employment statistics still show a gender divide, particularly when it comes<br> to women. But, this is changing.<br>Today, we have more female role models in the tech industry than ever before. Let's see a few of the amazing<br> women ruling the tech world today.</p>

                <h2>Kimberly Bryant</h2>
                <h4>Founder and CEO of Black Girls Code</h4>
                <div class="image_s" style="height:200px;"><img src="kbryant.jpg" alt="Kimberly Bryant"></div>
                <p>Kimberly Bryant excelled at science and mathematics as a child and earned a scholarship to Vanderbilt University. There, she obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering with minors in mathematics and computer science.<br>

                    For more than two decades, Bryant took on technical leadership roles in several pharmaceutical and biotech companies, including Novartis and Merck.<br>
                    
                    It wasn't until her daughter showed an interest in computer science that Bryant realized there was still a lack of Black women in the science, technology, engineering and math professions. This gap wasn't due to a lack of interest -- it was due to a lack of access and exposure to STEM topics.<br>
                    
                    Bryant founded Black Girls Code in 2011, a San Francisco nonprofit that exposes girls of color ages 7 to 17 to STEM subjects. Here, girls can learn in-demand skills as they think about what they want to be when they grow up. The organization has the goal of teaching 1 million Black girls to code by 2040. Today, the organization has 16 chapters across the United States and one chapter in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

                    In her research, Crawford seeks to understand the benefits and dangers of AI and machine learning in the broader context of history, politics, labor, the environment and other sectors. Crawford advocates for mindful and respectful AI development. Her work examines how those technologies could potentially lead to bias, labor and supply chain disruptions, economic impacts due to automation, and privacy violations and curtailment of rights from increased surveillance.<br>
                    
                    Crawford's work has been featured in Nature, Science, The New York Times and The Atlantic. Her insight has led to multiple speaking engagements and advisory roles to policymakers at the United Nations and the White House.<br>
                    
                    Crawford co-founded New York University's AI Now Institute in 2017, the first university institute dedicated to researching the social impact of AI, and the first women-led and founded AI institute. The institute's goal is to change how researchers look at AI and expand their interpretation of it from a technical standpoint to include history, sociology and law to inform their development decisions.</p>
